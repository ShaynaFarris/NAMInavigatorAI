Helpline Overview

The helpline is often a person’s first encounter with NAMI North Carolina. Our support and empathy may be the first positive experience this person has had related to their or their loved one’s mental health condition. The mission of NAMI North Carolina is to provide support, education, advocacy, and public awareness so that all affected by mental illness can build better lives. One way we provide support for North Carolinians is through our statewide helpline.  Our helpline is open for families and individuals affected by mental illness and is free and confidential. The NAMI NC Helpline is available Monday through Friday, 8:30 am – 5:00 pm. Our helpline provides invaluable warm support, resources, referrals, information, hope, and compassion to callers.


Phone: 1-800-451-9682 or 919-788-0801, choose option 1
Email: mail@naminc.org or helpline@naminc.org
Text: 1-919-999-6527


Please note: 

    • If a caller is in crisis and needs immediate help, he/she should contact a provider or mobile crisis unit. You can locate a walk-in crisis center by county HERE. Callers can also call 911 and ask for a CIT officer. Providers have an ethical obligation to respond to their clients. Code of Ethics can be found here (section A. 12.).

    • If the caller is feeling suicidal, he/she should call the National Suicide Hotline at 988.

    • Callers can also contact the NAMI crisis line by texting “NAMI” to 741-741.



The types of calls, emails, and texts that come in may be from people living with mental illness or symptoms of, friends and family members of those living with mental illness, NAMI NC members and volunteers, mental health professionals, and other nonprofits or community partners. Commonly used resources are found at the end of this guide and should be kept handy by helpline responders.









Policies

Helpline responders should adhere to certain policies or a system of principles. In other words, some “do’s and don’ts”.  Specifically, what the helpline aims to do is:

    • Advance NAMI NC’s goal of increasing support, education, advocacy and public awareness
    • Empower each caller with information and referrals
    • Give compassionate guidance and warm support
    • Provide excellent service

There are also policies set around what the helpline does not provide. There are clear-cut “don’ts” for helpline responders to follow when assisting callers. Limitations of the helpline include:

    • Counseling or Therapy - We do not provide these services. Instead, we offer empathy, understanding and support.
    • Advice – We do not provide advice. We identify options. 
    • Individual casework, legal representation or other types of individual advocacy – We do not provide these services.
    • Crisis situations – We do not engage in crisis or suicide situations with callers. *


While we are not a crisis phone line, we may get calls where we hear that there is an immediate crisis, and it is important to handle the crisis appropriately. 

* If you are involved in a crisis call– stay calm, assure the person you are concerned about helping them.  Explain to the person that you are not a trained counselor and that you will help them speak to a professional specially trained to assist them. Transfer the call to the appropriate crisis number. If the caller is in crisis and needs immediate help, he/she can contact a provider or mobile crisis unit. You can locate a walk-in crisis center by county HERE. Callers can also call 911. If caller is feeling suicidal, he/she should call the National Suicide Hotline at 988. Callers can contact the NAMI crisis line by texting “NAMI” to 74174 to be connected to a helping professional 24 hours a day. Again, providers have an ethical obligation to respond to their clients. Code of Ethics can be found here (section A. 12.).









Procedures

The procedure or set of steps to respond to a Helpline call are as follows:

    1. Calls (and/or emails) are to be answered at the time they come in or responded to in a timely manner. Specifically, within an hour. Calls can be routed to the CelitoMobile app. This free application can be downloaded to any smartphone. Here is the link to the app. This technology allows calls to be answered remotely. Voicemails left are sent to the registered email address as an audio file. For technical assistance with Celito Mobile, email support@celito.net, or call 919-852-1238, press “1”.

    2. Use the following script when answering calls, “Good Morning/Afternoon, NAMI North Carolina Helpline. How may I help you?”

    3. Listen. Remain calm, non-judgmental, and patient. Be a good listener and allow the caller to vent. It is important that they feel heard. Do not debate, argue, or make assumptions. Practice active listening skills (found here). Helpline Responders need to listen carefully in order to refer the caller to the appropriate resource(s).

    4. The caller will most likely explain their situation in detail without much prompting. However, for tracking purposes, Helpline Responders should try to collect the following information:

    • Date of call
    • Type of inquiry (support, referral, complaint). If it is a complaint, please note what type of complaint and gather any other relevant information related to the complaint. We want specifics.
    • Type of contact (call, email, chat, social media)
    • Is the call concerning an adult or child?
    • How did the caller learn of NAMI NC (aka: referred by)?
    • County the caller is in
    • Issue
    • Referred to – please be specific. For example, note which NAMI Affiliate as opposed to only noting: “NAMI Affiliate”. 
    • Enter any additional notes
    • Note who entered the data.

Every contact will be logged in Survey Monkey. The form is found here. 

    5. Helpline Responders must determine the best method of assisting callers based on the issues/needs being reported. Helpline Responders should stay mindful of the outlined policies and be knowledgeable of resources available to callers. A list of commonly used resources is included in this manual.

    6. After assisting callers, Helpline Responders should log the call. 

    7. Practice debriefing and self-care if necessary. More details follow in the training section. 

     









































Training Responders

All Helpline Responders should review the policies and procedures described in this manual. As outlined in the procedures section, responders should remain calm, non-judgmental, and patient. It is important to be a good listener. It is not appropriate to debate or argue. Helpline Responders may be able to de-escalate the situation through communication – ask relevant questions and listen.

We want to let callers know that they are not alone, and support is available. Helpline Responders should become familiar with the resources available as well as NAMI’s signature programs and support groups (for example: Family to Family, Peer to Peer, In Our Own Voice, BASICS, Sharing Hope, NAMI Smarts for Advocacy, NAMI Homefront, Peer Connections Support Groups, and Family Support Groups). Descriptions of these programs and support groups can be found at nami.org or by clicking here. Helpline Responders should be prepared to refer the caller to the appropriate program, group or other local service agency.
	
When police assistance is involved, callers should be advised to request a CIT trained officer if possible. Crisis intervention team (CIT) is a program designed to help police officers react appropriately to situations involving mental illness, developmental disability or emotionally disturbed persons. CIT programs enhance communication, identify mental health resources for assisting people in crisis and ensure that officers get the training and support that they need (nami.org, 2018). Learn more about CIT training here.

Reminder: 

    • If the caller is in crisis and needs immediate help, he/she should call 911 and request a CIT officer, contact a crisis center/mobile crisis, and/or contact a provider.
    • If the caller is feeling suicidal, he/she should call the National Suicide Hotline at 988. This hotline is open 24/7/365 and available in English or Spanish speakers. 
    • Callers can also contact the NAMI crisis line by texting “NAMI” to 741-741.


Some calls/emails to our helpline can be difficult to handle. The unique stressors that callers are facing can influence their communication skills. Emotions, family dynamics, and the varying circumstances of the callers can impact the tone of the conversation. Sometimes debriefing may be needed after a call. You can learn more about debriefing here. 

To ensure that our helpline responders are equipped to assist others, self-care is strongly advised. Some useful tips on self-care are found here.


Tracking Call Data


The Helpline Manager is responsible for submitting monthly and quarterly reports. It is crucial that all contacts to the Helpline are logged in. Every contact must be logged in Survey Monkey. The form is found here.

	Helpline responders should enter the data from the call, email, or text to the best of their ability. Additional notes can be added towards the bottom of the log. This space should be used to add specific details as needed.
	
Tracking calls and emails to our helpline helps identify patterns in inquiries, creates a sense of accountability, helps with reporting requirements, and serves as a teaching tool.
































Resources in NC
	
Callers should be informed of their options and referred to appropriate resources. Helpline Responders do not make recommendations or give advice. Commonly used resources follow:

Appendix C

Using the Involuntary Commitment Process

Who can file involuntary commitment papers?

Anyone with knowledge that a person is dangerous to himself or others due to mental illness and/or substance abuse may go to the local magistrate’s office to file a petition for involuntary commitment. Sometimes this is a family member, a friend, or a healthcare professional. 

What does the magistrate do? 

If the magistrate finds the criteria are met, an order will be issued for custody and transportation of the person alleged to be in need of examination and treatment. The person is not under arrest, but he or she cannot leave. The custody order assures the person’s safety and the safety of others so that there is time to evaluate whether the person needs treatment and if so, where that treatment will happen. 

Where will the person be taken by law enforcement if he or she isn’t already at the hospital? 

A law enforcement officer will take the person to a facility for the examination. A list of facilities in NC is found HERE. 

What happens if the medical professional finds the person needs inpatient commitment? 

If the examiner (doctor) finds the person meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the staff of the crisis center or hospital emergency department will search for a bed in a psychiatric (24 hour) facility. This may take a short time and the patient may be admitted to a 24-hour facility close to home. Or, the person may be held for hours or even days in the crisis center or emergency department until a bed is available somewhere in the state. 

Inpatient bed availability depends on numerous factors including the individual’s diagnosis and symptoms, financial resources, the age of the person, other medical factors, and the number of open beds at any particular time. When a bed is available the person will again be transported by a law enforcement officer to the 24‐hour facility. Another examination must be performed at admission or within 24 hours of arrival. 





How long does the involuntary commitment process last?

If the examiner (doctor) finds the person does not meet the criteria for commitment, the involuntary commitment proceeding ends. When this occurs, the law enforcement officer will release the person from custody and return him to his residence. Also, if a patient has been waiting for seven days without a bed at a 24-hour facility being located, the process must start over. 

Will the patient have a lawyer? 

The patient will be assigned a lawyer who specializes in involuntary commitments after he or she arrives at a psychiatric (24-hour) facility and has the second exam. Until that time, though, the patient is in the middle of the process where the state does not yet appoint a lawyer. The patient or the patient’s family certainly may contact a lawyer for assistance at any time during the process, but a lawyer is not provided for him or her by the state until after placement in a 24-hour facility is found. Remember, the patient is not under arrest, and involuntary commitment is civil, not criminal.

Appendix D

Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs)

Do you want more say in your mental health treatment? Would you or your loved one like to be better prepared for a mental health crisis in the future? NAMI North Carolina supports the efforts to increase public awareness of Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs), and is a leader in encouraging the development of PADs as a tool of self-advocacy and effective crisis planning.
A Psychiatric Advance Directive is a legal document that tells treatment providers your preferences for treatment in a mental health crisis. You can give consent for or decline specific future psychiatric treatment, AND/OR authorize a trusted person to make treatment decisions in a crisis, based on your written preferences (also called health care power of attorney or health care agent). If you are in a psychiatric crisis and in a state of mind where you cannot speak for yourself or communicate treatment decisions, the crisis treatment provider can activate your PAD.
